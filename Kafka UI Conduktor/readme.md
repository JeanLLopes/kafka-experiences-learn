## Conduktor - Kafka GUI
Kafka does not come bundled with a UI, but I have created a software name Conduktor to help you use Kafka visually.

WebSite:
https://www.conduktor.io/

You can download Conduktor here: https://www.conduktor.io/

Conduktor allows you to perform all the administrative tasks on Kafka (such as creating topics, partitions, etc), as well as produce and consume, all from within a desktop application that should work on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
